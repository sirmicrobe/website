Microbial populations rapidly evolve to dynamic environments due to high population sizes and short generation times. Understanding how and why microbes evolve in response to their environment is crucial to treating infections. I am interested in the interface between evolution, ecology, and metabolism, and what these factors can tell us about host adaptation. 

Current projects investigating _in vivo_ evolution:

1. Rapid interstrain recombination in _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ generates adaptations to biofilm growth during chronic infections
2. Population genomics of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ in response to viral infections in cystic fibrosis
3. Within patient evolution of drug resistant _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _Acinetobacter baumannii_
4. Improving detection of culprit pathogens through bacterial DNA sequencing can impact antibiotic management decisions in severe pneumonia
