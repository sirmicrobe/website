Life is the movement of electrons for the purpose of energy conservation. The scope of these electron transfer reactions in bacteria and archaea is beautifully eloquent and diverse. I use bioelectrochemical systems (electrodes) to monitor electron transfer reactions in biofilms. These systems allow for the real-time study of metabolic activity, disturbance challenges, diffusion limitations, and turnover of the microbial community.
